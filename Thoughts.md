# Thoughts about the ESSAY
* Focused on the Secretflow SPU usage. 
    * Bried introduction to the architect and the SPU component
    * In the given essay, the details of spu design is fully and clearly displayed, but I'm not the developer of this, so not much details on it should be added to the essay.
    * Maybe possible to show an example of PSI demostration using the framework *(In the given essay, the example is Yao's millionaire problem)*.
* Comparison
    * Choices on the models, like `MNIST` and `CIFAR10`
    * Choices on other frameworks, like `TF Encrypted` and `MP-SPDZ`
    * Give the sample code (partly)
    * Set benchmark and do the comparison between these frameworks on some points like the final accuracy after running same epochs. 
    * Give several tables to illustrate the statistics
* Problems 
    * I'm not familiar with all the other frameworks currently
    * Some ML models enabled convolutional neural network, I'm not familiar with how to build the model by jax
